A standard ToDo app written in React with Tudor era semantic styling.

## Description

This app was made to practice using React after learning the basics from [Maximilian Schwarzmuller](https://github.com/maxschwarzmueller)'s class. The app focuses on storing state and using the state to print out the tasks on the screen for the selected day.

### Key Functionality:
- Create and write ToDo apps and save them to specific days
- Edit / Delete data
- Write and create new ToDos as needed
- Scroll through the month / filter the date as needed

## Roadmap - (Goals and ToDos)

## My Design Process

I decided to create a Tudor style ToDo list complete with a color palette and a Tudor era Rose. The color palette is simple and uses a lot of tans and browns with some red green and yellow thrown in to brighten it up and call attention to the main ToDo list.

The initial design was first drawn up in Figma and then produced with React.js
